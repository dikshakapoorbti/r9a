## 🤖 What is AI?

**AI = Artificial Intelligence = Smart Robots**

Think of AI like a really smart helper robot that can:
- Read super fast (like reading 1,000 books in 1 minute!)
- Remember everything (like having a perfect memory)
- Learn from mistakes (like getting better at a video game)
- Do boring tasks so people can do fun things!

Now let's meet our 6 robot helpers! 🚀

### What Does It Do?
This robot can predict the future! Well, kind of...

**Imagine:**

- Some customers buy lemonade every day (good customers!)
- Some customers stop coming (sad!)
- This robot can tell you WHO will stop coming BEFORE they leave

**How Does It Work?**

**Step 1: The Robot Watches**
